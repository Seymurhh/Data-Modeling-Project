| :-------:| :------- |
| id| **Unique ID for each home sold (it is not a predictor)**    |
| date| *Date of the home sale*    |
| price| *Price of each home sold*    |
| bedrooms| *Number of bedrooms*    |
| bathrooms| *Number of bathrooms, where ".5" accounts for a bathroom with a toilet but no shower*    |

## Instructions:

0.  Join a team with your fellow students with appropriate size (Four Students total)
1.  Load and Review the dataset named "KC_House_Sales'csv
2.	Create the train data set which contains 70% of the data and use set.seed (1023). The remaining 30% will be your test data set.
3.	Investigate the data and combine the level of categorical variables if needed and drop variables as needed. For example, you can drop id, Latitude, Longitude, etc.
4.	Build a regression model to predict price. 
5.	Create scatter plots and a correlation matrix for the train data set. Interpret the possible relationship between the response.
6.	Build the best multiple linear models by using the stepwise selection method. Compare the performance of the best two linear models. 
7.	Make sure that model assumption(s) are checked for the final model. Apply remedy measures (transformation, etc.) that helps satisfy the assumptions. 
8.	Investigate unequal variances and multicollinearity. If necessary, apply remedial methods (WLS, Ridge, Elastic Net, Lasso, etc.). 
9.	Build an alternative model based on one of the following approaches to predict price: regression tree, NN, or SVM.  Check the applicable model assumptions. Explore using a logistic regression. 
10.	Use the test data set to assess the model performances from above.
11.	Based on the performances on both train and test data sets, determine your primary (champion) model and the other model which would be your benchmark model.
12.	Create a model development document that describes the model following this template, input the name of the authors, Harvard IDs, the name of the Group, all of your code and calculations, etc..:
